      <h1>pay only for results</h1>
      <p>i don't get paid until you see results. that's the deal. if i can't get you where you need to be, you don't owe me anything.</p>
      <p>why? because i know this works. i've done it for my own businesses. and i'm not interested in taking your money for something that might work. i'm interested in taking your money for something that does.</p>

      <h2>how it works</h2>
      <p>1. we talk. you tell me about your business, what you're trying to achieve, who you're trying to reach.</p>
      <p>2. we define targets together. specific keywords for seo, specific queries for geo. no vague "get more traffic" nonsense. concrete, measurable goals.</p>
      <p>3. i do the work. strategy, implementation, optimization. this part's on me.</p>
      <p>4. we measure results. incognito testing, multiple accounts, documented proof that it's working.</p>
      <p>5. you pay when (and only when) we hit the targets we agreed on.</p>
