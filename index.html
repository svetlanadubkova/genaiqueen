      <h2>what even is geo?</h2>
      <p>you know seo. you optimize for google, google ranks you, people find you. that game isn't dead, but it's got company now.</p>
      <p>geo is generative engine optimization. it's the practice of making your business visible to ai systems that synthesize answers instead of just listing links. when someone asks chatgpt "who's the best photographer in austin?" or asks claude "what crm should i use for my startup?" those answers come from somewhere. geo is making sure they come from you.</p>
      <p>the major players right now: chatgpt, gemini, claude, perplexity, metaai, bing ai, and you.com. each works differently. each has preferences. and most businesses are completely invisible to all of them.</p>
      <p>this isn't hypothetical. this is happening right now. people are making purchasing decisions based on ai recommendations today. the question is whether those recommendations include you.</p>

      <h2>why this matters (the real talk version)</h2>
      <p>ai referral traffic to websites increased 357% year over year, reaching 1.13 billion visits by june 2025. that's not a typo. billion with a b. (source: <a href="https://techcrunch.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">techcrunch</a>)</p>
      <p>remember when google first came out? the businesses that figured out organic search early made absolute fortunes while their competitors were still buying newspaper ads. geo is that moment again. right now. the window where early movers get outsized returns because most people haven't caught on yet.</p>
      <p>the difference is that ai search doesn't just rank you. it recommends you. it actively tells people to hire you, buy from you, trust you. that's a fundamentally different kind of visibility than showing up on page one of a list.</p>
      <p>i've been tracking this shift obsessively. reading the research papers (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.09735" target="_blank" rel="noopener">aggarwal et al., 2024</a>; <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08919" target="_blank" rel="noopener">chen et al., 2025</a>), running experiments on my own businesses, watching what actually moves the needle. the findings are clear: this can be optimized. it's not random. and most people are doing it wrong or not at all.</p>

    <section>
      <h2>the investment math</h2>
      <p>traditional marketing: you pay for every click, forever. the moment you stop paying, you stop existing.</p>
      <p>seo and geo: you invest once in getting found, then the traffic is free. forever. every lead, every customer, every recommendation costs you nothing after the initial work.</p>
      <p>i've gotten more than 60% of my work for the past 2 years through organic search. that's hundreds of thousands of dollars in business from $0 in ad spend. the roi isn't good. it's absurd.</p>
      <p>geo is the same opportunity but even better, because ai doesn't just list you. it advocates for you.</p>
