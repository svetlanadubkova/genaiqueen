      <h1>hi, i'm lana</h1>

      <p>i've been freelancing for about a decade. photographer, mostly, but also various other creative hustles along the way. in all that time i've spent exactly $0 on advertising.</p>

      <p>not because i'm anti-ads. because i never needed them. i figured out early that if you show up where people are looking, they find you. first it was google. then google maps. now it's ai.</p>

      <p>when i started noticing leads coming in from chatgpt recommendations, i got curious. then i got obsessive. i started testing. reading research papers. running experiments on my own businesses. i got one of them to #1 on metaai within 24 hours. chatgpt recommends me for my target queries. this stuff works, and it's not magic. it's methodology.</p>

      <p>the research backs it up. <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.09735" target="_blank" rel="noopener">aggarwal et al.</a> showed that geo can boost visibility up to 40% in generative engine responses. <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08919" target="_blank" rel="noopener">chen et al.</a> documented how different ai platforms have different preferences and biases. <a href="https://about.ads.microsoft.com/en/blog/post/october-2025/optimizing-your-content-for-inclusion-in-ai-search-answers" target="_blank" rel="noopener">microsoft</a> published findings on how ai systems parse content modularly. this is a real field now, with real data, and i've been in it since before it had a name.</p>

      <p>i'm not a marketing agency. i'm not going to give you a 47-page deck full of jargon. i'm someone who figured out how to get found, did it for myself, and now does it for others. research-backed. results-based. no bullshit.</p>
